- **Paypal payment process**
-  **User authentication and authorization**
-  **User functionalities**, such as order history, and **admin functionalities** such as real-time metrics (registered users, order count, total money orders), creation, editing, and deletion of products.
<br>


##  Frontend Implementation 
The frontend is built using **React.js**, using React features such as hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and state management using **Redux**. It includes components and routing to create an interactive user experience.

### Key React features:
1. **React Components**: Utilizes functional components and hooks to manage state and side effects, promoting code reusability and simplification.
2. **Redux State Management**: Manages the global state of the application, including user authentication, product listing, and shopping cart state. Redux Thunk is used for asynchronous operations.
3. **Routing with React Router**: Implements dynamic routing for different parts of the application, including product pages, user login, and the shopping cart.
4. **State Management with useState and useEffect**: Manages local component state and side effects, ensuring components respond to changes in application state efficiently.
5. **Asynchronous Operations with Redux Thunk**: Handles asynchronous logic such as fetching data from the backend.


## Backend Implementation 
The backend of this e-commerce website is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, connecting to **MongoDB Atlas** for database management. It includes secure user authentication with **Firebase** and implements API endpoints to handle various functionalities such as product management, user management, and order processing.

### Key Components of the Backend:
1. **Database Management with MongoDB Atlas**: 
   `MongoDB Atlas` is a cloud-based NoSQL database used to manage the application's data efficiently. The database is designed to handle collections for `products, and orders`.

   - **Orders Collection**: Stores order details including items, shipping address, payment method, and user information.
   - **Products Collection**: Contains product information such as name, category, price, stock status, and reviews.

<br>


2. **Express.js for API Development**: 
   `Express.js` is used to create a RESTful API to handle `HTTP requests` and responses, ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and the backend. The API endpoints are 



3. **User Authentication with Firebase**: 
   `Firebase` Authentication is integrated to manage user `sign-up, login, and secure sessions`.
